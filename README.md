# Ranktration

Rank/compare algorithms, models, or approaches with weighted multi-criteria analysis.

## How It Works

1. **Collect trajectories** - Gather approaches with measurable metrics
2. **Smart sampling** - Select representative sample for large datasets
3. **Pairwise battles** - Compare sample trajectories using weighted scores
4. **Tournament ranking** - Establish global rankings through competitive analysis
5. **Statistical confidence** - Measure ranking stability and significance
6. **Final scoring** - Apply ranking bonuses to create comprehensive evaluation
